Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Florida working with Prof. Imre Bartos. I am interested in analyzing gravitational-wave data to understand origins of binary black hole systems. I specialize in the analysis of gravitational waves from binary black holes with eccentric orbits. Please feel free to reach out via email if you are interested in my research!

Before starting my Ph.D. in 2019, I was a BS-MS student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata, and my research involved developing algorithms to optimize template-based searches that are used to detect gravitational waves.

Outisde of research, I like to  play the guitar, cook, watch movies and discover new coffee spots with my friends.

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
